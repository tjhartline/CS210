Title: Corner Grocery Cart

Language: C++ & Python

Description:	
This program was created as part of my SNHU CS-210 Coursework.
It was the final Project. The program is meant to display a menu
that allows user to input 1-4 for their selection to view a printout
of the item inventory stored in a .txt file. It then iterates through
the list to count the total number of times each item is listed in file,
as each time an item is listed (named) counts as a purchase. The user
can also select an option to enter a specific item to view how many times
that item was purchased. Another option is to view these items as a Histogram
that prints a '*' to represent each purchase as a tally mark. The final option is 
to exit the program. 

What I did well:
My best feature or programming habit is my attention to detail, organization, note taking,
testing features, and using industry standard best practices to write clean and understandable 
programs. Keeping the code stucture organized and creating functions to limit the amount
of code stored in main that allowed me to test each section individually.

Where I can improve my code, making it more secure and efficient: 
Making more options private and continuing to learn security standards.
Also continuing to learn about machine code, and becoming more aware of
the byte storage required as I code to make sure I am creating the most efficient
program.

What I found most challenging:
Menu option two. Option two is where the user is allowed to input an item name and the
program returns the number of times that item has been purchased. While options 1, 3, and
4 were fairly easy, I had a hard time getting the program to correctly read user input.
It would output a single item, and the number of times it was purchased, but it was not the 
item the user had entered. To overcome, I continued to test and debug each time I would make 
a change to a line of code. While I was able to get the program to output correctly for the item
entered, I am continuing to edit and test the program to get the correct return statement when
a user enters an item that is not in the purchase list.

What skills from this project are transferable:
Integrating C++ with Python. The ability to use multiple languages to create a program is 
a must have skill as a developer, and is already helping me write better querys and reports
using SQL, which can also take C++, and POWERBI which allows Python coding.

How I made my program maintainable, readable and adaptable:
Using functions for each option that can be easily decoupled from other sections of the program
to allow better and faster testing. I also used inline comments and descriptive function names,
to make the program easy to read and understand.
